# 🎮 Pac-Man AI Game

A Python Pac-Man game featuring intelligent ghosts using different pathfinding algorithms (DFS, BFS, A*).

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and run
git clone https://github.com/sabbirog/PacMan-game.git
cd PacMan-game
python game.py
```

## 🎯 Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Arrow Keys | Move Pac-Man |
| Z | Shoot beam |
| 1/2/3 | Change difficulty (DFS/BFS/A*) |
| Escape | Pause/Resume |
| Enter | Start game |

## 🧠 AI Algorithms

- **Easy (DFS)**: Depth-First Search - explores deeply, not optimal
- **Medium (BFS)**: Breadth-First Search - finds shortest path
- **Hard (A*)**: A* Search - optimal with heuristic

## 🎮 Game Features

- Smart ghosts with territories
- Real-time combat with beams
- 5 lives system
- Collect all pellets to win
- Switch difficulty during gameplay
